In the Folder Above I have made a memory game known as the "Simon Game".
This is made with Javascript (JS), HTML, and plain old CSS.
The rules are as follows:

1) You can press any key to start the game
2) After pressing a key, it will highlight a button.
3) You need to click at the correctly highlighted button or else its game over.
4) It you click at the correct button, you will clear round 1.
5) Each round a button will be highghlited and you need to remember the order in which the butttons were clicked {Example: If in round 1, it highlighted the red button and in round 2, it highlighted the blue button, you will need to click at the red button and then the blue button (as this was the order in which the buttons were highlighted ) }
6) As soon as you click all the highlighted buttons correctly, the next round will start automatically
7) This game has NO END. It will keep highlighting buttons each round.
8) All the best! Hope you enjoy üòÅüòÅ. If you liked this game then follow me on github as I will post more games soon!
